i need first to divide the page for six section or components which are 

1-header 
2-hero
3-about
4-proejcts
5-skills
6-footer

then it depends on what you need to fill every section with the content you desire

so i filled for example header with some anchor tags refering the other sections

i used tailwindcss in this project and i encountered some problems with the last version of tailwind 4.0.17 so i installed 3.4.14 and it worked with this version of angular

i would like to mention this is my first project using angular so i knew some concepts like data binding how components talk to each other how you can send data from a typescript file to an html file for example also property binding and event binding
